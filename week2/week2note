Vector space model:

term frequency:the count of a term in the document
count of word in query/doc as weight

Inverse Document Frequency(IDF): penalize common words, reward rare words
IDF(W)=log[(M+1)/k]      k:doc freq   M:total # of docs in collection

IDF better than linear relation: more # of docs in collection, less effect in weight

TF-IDF weighting: term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting
problem for above design: redundant of one word, lack of other words still get high score

solution to above problem: TF transformation
