0	947977	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/456915	21	Now , I will summarize my opinion .

0	420606	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	1	I will write down something I have thought about during exam period .
0	420607	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	2	1 .
0	420608	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	3	recently I sleep A LOT . I sleep for about 8 hours and I think this is too much . to make matters worse , I get up at around 10 am ( absolutely TOO LATE ! ) as I usually go to bed at 2 am . I really feel I do n't have time in the morning .
0	420609	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	4	so I will try to do these things to solve this problem :
0	420610	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	5	- go to bed by 1 am ( this would help to get up earlier )
0	420611	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	6	- make my room warmer ( I guess I did n't wanna wake up and leave my bed this morning because it was cold in my room )
1	420612	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	7	these sound only small changes , but I strongly believe these accumulation will lead to big improvement .	these sound like only small changes , but I strongly believe these will lead to big improvement .

0	420614	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	9	in order to concentrate on my work in my room , I will try to keep sitting up straight in a chair . I will not lean back in my chair .
1	420615	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	10	I found that when I can focus on my work , im siting up and feel my head is clear .	I found that when I can focus on my work , I 'm sitting up and feel my head is clear .
0	420616	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	11	( im not 100 % sure but I think this effect is proven by science ) but conversely , when im study ineffectively and so slowly , I lean back in my chair .
0	420617	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	12	so I think if I sit up straight , this would lead to effective work .
0	420618	http://lang-8.com/9564/journals/818078	13	ok now its the time to go back to my work . . .
